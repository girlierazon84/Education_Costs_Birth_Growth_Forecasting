  # Choose how to extend costs beyond the last observed year in the cost tables.

  #   - "carry_forward": hold last known cost constant
  #   - "growth_rate": grow last known cost forward by annual_growth_rate
  extrapolation: "growth_rate"

  # Anchor year for keeping a realistic split between "fixed" and "current" bases.
  # We use an anchor where both series exist and are meaningful (e.g., 2021).

  # Adjust if you change your cohort logic.
